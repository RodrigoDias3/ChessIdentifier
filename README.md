## **Features**
- Detects and extracts the chessboard from an image.
- Identifies the pieces on the board.
- Provides a structured representation of the board.

**Outputs statistics such as:**
- Number of pieces per team (White & Black).
- Position of each piece.
- Piece Notation

## The program uses the following notation to represent the chess pieces:

**X → Empty square**

**White Pieces (Uppercase):**
- C → Knight
- T → Rook
- Q → Queen
- B → Bishop
- K → King
- P → Pawn

**Black Pieces (Lowercase):**
- c → Knight
- t → Rook
- q → Queen
- b → Bishop
- k → King
- p → Pawn

## **How?**
This program is based on image processing and pixel manipulation.

Each pixel is divided into 3 layers:
- Red, which represents the reds
- Green, which represents the greens
- Blue, which represents the blues

You can manipulate the pixels to do certain things, such as
- Rotations
- Cropping
- Contrast
- Scale
- Convert to Black and White
- Mean
- Binarization
- Histograms
